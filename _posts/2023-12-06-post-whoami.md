# Hello!

Hey, my name is Eoghan! I am a Hardware Hacker and Penetration tester who is pasionate about info-sec/cyber-sec. When I'm not hacking I enjoy playing CTFs from [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/), [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://www.offsec.com/labs/), etc; then sharring my key leasons learned.

I started this blog to share my passion for pentesting/web hacking/hardware hacking with all of you!

From this blog you can expect posts about
- CTF challenges
- intresting things I've learned
- and updates on my many hardware projects.

At the time of the most recent update I have my [eJPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/) form eLearnSecurity, and am studying for the [eCPPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ecppt-certification/) exam. After that I plan on going for the [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/).

Come along and we'll share this journey if you feel like it.

<br>

I look forward to seeing you in cyber-space:

\- Eoghan West (Calacuda)
